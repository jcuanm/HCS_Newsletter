                        Facebook's awesome entry-level Rotational Product Manager Program!<br><br>

                        Implemented in 2011, the RPM Program is open to new and recent grads who are

                        Chris Marra (Olin ’12) and Roy Zhang (Harvard ’13) will talk about how and why the 
                        program was created, what it consists of and how it continues to influence our company 
                        and organization. Chris and Roy both joined Facebook through the RPM Program and have 
                        contributed to a number of high-impact products such as Android, Ads, Photos, Search, 
                        and more.<br><br>

                        On Wednesday September 16 at 4 PM in Fong Auditorium, Boylston Hall, Jane Street 
                        will be hosting a Tech Talk. Yaron Minsky, Jane Street's head oftechnology, will 
                        be talking about How to Build an Exchange. Plenty of food and beverages will be 
                        served and we encourage you to come learn more aboutJane Street's technology!<br><br>

                        Electronic exchanges play an important role in the world financial system, 
                        acting as focal points where actors from across the world meet to trade with each other.<br><br>

                        But building an exchange is a difficult technical challenge, requiring high 
                        transaction rates, low, deterministic response times, fairness, and reliability.<br><br>

                        We'll look at the question of how to design an exchange through the lens of JX, a 
                        crossing engine we built at Jane Street in the last two years.  Performance plays 
                        an interesting role in this design, in that, although the end-to-end latency of the 
                        system is not important in and of itself, the ability of individual components of JX 
                        to handle messages rates in the 500k/sec range with latencies in the single-digit 
                        microseconds helped us build a replicated system that is both simple and robust.<br><br>
