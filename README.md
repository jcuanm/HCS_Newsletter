# HCS_Newsletter
This is the HTML and CSS for a sample interactive newsletter that was distributed to the Harvard University student body in order to advertise various Harvard Computer Society events. I directly modified the HTML and CSS on Gmail in order to get the newsletter to be in the correct format. Because of this, I was unable to create a CSS style 
sheet, so all of the style is directly inserted into the HTML, which is admittedly very ugly. If you paste the this HTML into an empty 
window, you will see the newsletter, but since it was meant to be in an email, the format might look a little strange. For example, the 
text is far too small for an internet window, but it is the perfect size for text in an email.
